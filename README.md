# Fishing-Cat

It's small game made in unity 2019.4.9f1. It's fishing game.

## Feature

### Fishing rod

When holding LMB, a bar appears, indicating the power of the throw. The longer player holds LMB, the more the bar will fill and the farther the hook will fly. The hook is connected to the tub by a distance joint. When the hook is in the water, after pressing LMB, the hook will start to move towards the player. When the hook leaves water, it will be automatically transferred to the fishing rod. If there is a bait on the hook, the fish will use it.

### Catalog

By pressing the tab button, a catalog with fish appears. All fish appear there, divided into three categories: small, medium and large. Fish that weren't caught before appear as a black fish icon and information about it is replaced with question marks. However, when the fish has been caught, the icon is no longer black and the information is declassified. Catalog slots are added automatically.

### Fight with fish

At the moment when fish catches the bait, it can eat it and swim away (if the fish is larger than the bait), or catch the hook. If it catches a hook, player must fight the fish. A bar with a fish symbol and a background divided into colored segments appear on the left side. The fish icon can be moved by pressing the A (moves left) and D (moves left). Depending on which color the fish icon is on, a different effect will take place. In the middle there is a green color which increases the speed of pulling the fish. There is a red color in both ends of the bar. When the fish icon is there, the fish will break off the hook. There is yellow between green and red, which has no special effects. The fish is being pulled at a normal pace. During the fight, the fish icon will randomly move left and right at a speed depending on the size of the fish.
